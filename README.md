# Task 7 HTML & CSS & JS
## In this task, you need to create basic pages for your future web application.
1. All pages must be created using plain HTML and CSS.
2. Similar styles between the pages might be extracted into separate files to avoid copy-paste.

### Application requirements
1. Use Material as a source of svg icons.
2. Using CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less is allowed and advisable.

### Application restrictions 
  3rd party web component libraries (i.e. Bootstrap, Foundation, Polymer) are not allowed.

## Add JS to previous html templates
1. Save all data in the local storage
2. Data is ordered by creation date by default, newly added item should be on the top
3. Perform search by clicking on the tag or when user stop typing in the input
4. DOM manipulation should be performed on native js
5. Use `_.debounce()` or `_.throttle()` for scroll event handler to optimize your api requests in the future
